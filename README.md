Antimicrobial Peptide Prediction
Rationale:
This repository contains the implementation and results of antimicrobial peptide prediction, a critical aspect of understanding host defense mechanisms against microbial infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a crucial role in the innate immune system, acting as a first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens.
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to employ computational methods to predict potential antimicrobial peptides from given sequences. Understanding and predicting AMPs have significant implications for drug discovery, as these peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity and are being explored as alternatives to traditional antibiotics.
Key Features
Data Processing: The repository includes scripts for processing and cleaning the dataset used for training and evaluation.
Model Implementation: Utilizing machine learning and bioinformatics techniques, we implement models for predicting potential AMPs.
Evaluation Metrics: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is provided to assess the performance of the predictive models.
Results and Analysis: Detailed results, visualizations, and insights gained from the antimicrobial peptide prediction are presented.
